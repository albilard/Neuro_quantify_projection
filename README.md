# Neuro_quantify_projection
This repository contains code associated with the paper Mahadevia D. et al, 2021 "Dopamine promotes aggression in mice via ventral tegmental area to lateral septum projections", submitted on Nat Com. It was created in the Dumitriu lab to be used in a pipeline with Wholebrain ( https://github.comm/tractatus/wholebrain) to quantify easily neuronal projection in a ROIs, with a low demanding computation. It combines some R-scripts and imageJ macros.
